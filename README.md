# Hivelocity WHMCS Module (Community Version)

Hello Hivelocity GitHub community,

Due to the abandonment of the original plugin by its developers, I decided to create my own version of this module. I’m aware that there’s still work to be done, but it began as a separate module and gradually evolved to meet the real needs of users.

## 🔧 Features

- **Template Support**: Includes support for the **Twenty-One** template by default, instead of **Six**, as it's more complete and modern.
- **Billing Cycles**: Added more direct billing cycle options by integrating WHMCS's native billing periods.
- **Improved UI**: More structured and visually enhanced layout for the product view.
- **Backups View** (Addon):
  - Displays basic backup information.
  - Shows user credentials to the client.
  - Adds direct console access from the user menu.

## 🤝 Contributions

Any contributions, suggestions, or improvements are welcome! Let’s continue to improve and use this module as it was meant to be.

**Best regards!**

# Download and Installation

GitHub - hivelocity/bare-metal-provisioning-module-for-whmcs: Provision Hivelocity Dedicated Servers Automatically with The Bare Metal Provisioning Modules for WHMCS

## This is a steps by steps how to setup our WHMCS HV module.

All you need to get started is to have the Bare Metal module installed on your WHMCS, A https://my.hivelocity.net/sign-up , add a credit card on file to order servers.

This currently only works with the Six template.

### Step 1

- Create an account with us myVelocity and add a credit card on file to order servers.

> [!WARNING]
> Upload The Module: We recommend uploading the "bare-metal-provisioning-module-for-whmcs-master.tar.gz" file using your preferred method (scp, sftp, ftp, via cPanel file manager, etc...) directly to the server, extract it, the resulting extraction has three folders under "bare-metal-provisioning-module-for-whmcs-master/modules/" > "addons","servers" and templates.

### Old Way Module Installation:

Extract the file in tmp folder then move all contents to your whmcs installation folder.

Move the contents of "addons" folder to the path of /whmcs/ installation folder. This depends on where you set your WHMCS path ex. "/var/www/html/whmcs/modules/addons/"

### Step 2

- Login to WHMCS go to System settings -> Addon
- Activate the Hivelocity Pricing Tool Module under Addon Modules
- If you would like to receive emails on price changes, click the check box next to "Check if you want to receive an email notification about the price change of Hivelocity"

> [!WARNING]
> We recommend uploading the "bare-metal-provisioning-module-for-whmcs-master.tar.gz" file using your preferred method (scp, sftp, ftp, via cPanel file manager, etc...) directly to the server, extract it, the resulting extraction has two folders under "bare-metal-provisioning-module-for-whmcs-master/modules/" > "addons" and "servers".

### New way of Install

```
cd ~/ | git clone git@github.com:hivelocity/bare-metal-provisioning-module-for-whmcs.git ~/.

cp -Rs ~/bare-metal-provisioning-module-for-whmcs/modules/addons/HivelocityPricingTool/ [path to modules/addons folder]/HivelocityPricingTool/

cp -Rs ~/bare-metal-provisioning-module-for-whmcs/modules/servers/Hivelocity/ [path to modules/servers folder]/Hivelocity
```

Chown the directories by your web user if necessary.

Move the contents of "servers" folder to the path of /whmcs/ installation folder. This depends on where you set your WHMCS path ex. "/var/www/html/whmcs/modules/servers/"

## Step 3. Module configuration

### Server Setup

- Next go to System settings -> Servers Click add new server
- Under Module Select Hivelocity. Under Hostname enter core.hivelocity.net Under access hash enter your API Key you get out of your myVelocity then click continue.
- Give the server a Name Like Bare Metal or Dedicated Servers then go to the bottom and click save.
- Click Create New Group and name it whatever you like.
- Add your Hivelocity Server to the group.
- Create Products/Services
- Go to System Settings -> Products and Services.
- Click Create a new Group and give it a name.
- Select Order Form Template you want, and payment gateways then click save.
- Run the following cron and wait 5-10 minutes all products and configuration options are getting generated.
```
/usr/local/bin/php public_html/modules/addons/HivelocityPricingTool/cron.php
```

### Custom Options

- There are other options under the module setting of the product you can configure including Metric Billing Transfer In and Out or 95% In and Out.
- There are also addons which are included on the order form automatically when you generate configurable options.
- cPanel, WHMCS, Litespeed Web Server, Managed Services, Load Balancing, Extra Bandwidth, DDOS Protection, Data Migration and Backup & Rapid Restore.
- These modules currently only work with the six template.
- If you would like to manage the prices with the Hivelocity pricing tool, select the billing cycles you want enabled and leave it 0.00 and click save, then later you can mark it up in the Hivelocity pricing tool.
- Go to the Addons Menu then Hivelocity Pricing tool.
- You can either set your Profit margin individually or on all your servers at the top of the page. Add your percentage and click save or hit enter if you are doing them individually.
